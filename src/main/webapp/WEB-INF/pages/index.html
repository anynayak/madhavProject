<p>The 'Queen of the Arabian Sea', Cochin or Kochi is the largest city in Kerala. It is a perfect starting point to explore this exceptional state, which according to the National Geographic Travel magazine, is one of the 50 must-see destinations of a lifetime. Gifted with unmatched tropical greenery and beautiful lagoons, Kerala will leave you enchanted.</p>
<p>Being an important port city since the 14th century, Cochin has always been a centre of commerce and trade. It is a city that has always kept one foot in the past, celebrating its rich heritage of Dutch, Portuguese, British and traditional Carnatic influences. Through the years, Cochin has retained its quintessential warmth and originality, both of which permeate within the walls of Trident, Cochin.</p>
<p>Blending classic charm with chic interiors, Trident, Cochin offers 50 rooms, set amidst a picturesque central courtyard and landscaped gardens. Furnished in soft, muted tones and interspersed with local artefacts, the rooms are well-appointed with all the contemporary comforts for discerning guests. With views of the lush gardens from the large picture windows, the rooms bring the natural beauty of the outdoors within.</p>
<p>Located on Willingdon Island, Trident, Cochin is within easy distance of famed sites such as the Jewish Synagogue, Chinese fishing nets, Mattancherry Palace and St Francis Church. We would also recommend that you take some time to take a sunset cruise and explore the meandering backwaters.</p>
